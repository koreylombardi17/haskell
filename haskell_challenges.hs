-- The scalar product of two lists of integers xs and ys of length n is given by the sum of the products
-- Using a list comprehension, define a function that returns the scalar product of two lists.

-- Without looking at the standard prelude, define the following library functions using recursion:

-- and :: [Bool] -> Bool
and'' :: [Bool] -> Bool
and'' []     = True
and'' (x:xs) = x && and'' xs


-- Concatenate a list of lists:
-- concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
concat' :: [[a]] -> [a]
concat' []     = []

-- Produce a list with n identical elements:
-- replicate -> Int -> a -> [a]

-- Select the nth element of a list:

(!!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a
(!!!) [] _     = error "index too large"
(!!!) (x:xs) 0 = x
(!!!) (x:xs) n = (!!!) xs (n-1)


-- Decide if a value is an element of a list:
-- elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
elem' :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
elem' _ [] = False

-- Extend the abstract machine to support the use of multiplication.
-- Abstract Machine:

data Expr = Val Int | Add Expr Expr | Mult Expr Expr
type Cont = [Op]
data Op = EVAL Expr | ADD Int | MULT Int

eval :: Expr -> Cont -> Int
eval (Val n) c    = exec c n
eval (Add x y) c  = eval x (EVAL y : c)
eval (Mult x y) c = eval x (EVAL y : c)
-- eval evaluates an expression in the context of a control stack. That is, if the expression is an integer, it is
-- already fully evaluated, and we begin executing the control stack. If the expression is an addition, we
-- evaluate the first argument, x, placing the operation EVAL y on top of the control stack to indicate that
-- the second argument, y, should be evaluated once evaluation of the first argument is completed.

exec :: Cont -> Int -> Int
exec [] n = n
exec (EVAL y : c) n = eval y (ADD n : c)
exec (ADD n : c) m  = exec c (n+m)
exec (MULT n : c) m = exec c (n*m)
-- exec executes a control stack in the context of an integer argument. That is, if the control stack is empty,
-- we return the integer argument as the result of the execution. If the top of the control stack is an
-- operation EVAL y, we evaluate the expression y, placing the operation ADD n on top of the remaining
-- stack to indicate that the current integer argument, n, should be added together with the result of
-- evaluating y once this is completed. And finally, if the top of the stack is an operation ADD n, evaluation
-- of the two arguments of an addition expression is now complete, and we execute the remaining control
-- stack in the context of the sum of the two resulting integer values.

value :: Expr -> Int
value e = eval e []

-- Define an action adder :: IO () that reads a given number of integers from the key board, one per
-- line, and displays their sum. For example:
adder :: IO ()
adder =  do putStr "How many numbers do you want to add?"

            numbers <- get_numbers (read size :: Int)
            putStrLn ("Total = " ++ show (sum numbers))

						 numbers <- get_numbers (index - 1)
                         return (number : numbers)

-- Define a program
-- fibs :: [Integer]
-- that generates the infinite Fibonacci sequence
-- [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34, â€¦
-- using the following procedure:
-- a) The first two numbers are 0 and 1;
-- b) The next is the sum of the previous two;
-- c) Return to step 2.
-- II. Define a function
-- fib :: Int -> Integer
-- that calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
fibs :: [Integer]
